# Java gEneric DAta Integration (JEDAI) Toolkit
An open source, high scalability toolkit for data integration tasks, such as Record Linkage, Entity Resolution and Link Discovery.

JEDAI comprises a set of *generic*, *state-of-the-art* techniques that apply to any domain. At their core lies an approximate, *schema-agnostic* functionality based on *blocking* for high scalability.

JEDAI is a collaboration project involving the following partners:
* [Department of Informations and Telecommunications, University of Athens](http://www.di.uoa.gr),
* [Software and Knowledge Engineering Lab, National Center for Scientific Research "Demokritos"](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/skel) ,
* [Science-For-You not-for-profit company](http://www.scify.gr/site/en) and, 
* [LIPADE, Paris Descartes University](http://lipade.mi.parisdescartes.fr)
